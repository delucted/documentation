Events are a crucial Zyntex feature. They allow you to send a payload to either a Roblox server (or all servers) or to the Dashboard. 

## Use cases

1. **Live Events:** If you need to activate a live event across all servers, Zyntex Events makes that super simple.
2. **Session Recap:** Send a session recap for each player, which includes information such as how many levels they progressed and how many chests they opened.
3. **Discord Webhook:** You can set up events to automatically send a Discord webhook when they are invoked.
4. **Advanced Live Graphs:** Draw beautiful graphs as soon as invocations come in to properly analyze your data. By default, each event fires a live notification to all admins focused on your game in the dashboard
