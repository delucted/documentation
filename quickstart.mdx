## Setup an account

To create your account, please visit the [signup page](https://dashboard.zyntex.dev/signup).

## Link your game

After your account is set up, it's time to link a Roblox game. To start the process, visit [your Roblox settings](https://dashboard.zyntex.dev/settings#roblox) and select **Link New**.

From there, follow the instructions, which include pasting a line of code into your Roblox Studio command bar. If you do not trust the line of code, you can insert the module, verify its safety, and then proceed.

## Download the SDK

To download the SDK, please follow [these instructions](/download).

## Quick start

Below is a boilerplate example of how to start the Zyntex SDK. Below it, I explain what each major call does.

```lua
local Zyntex = require(path.to.zyntex)("YOUR-GAME-TOKEN")

Zyntex:init({
  debug = true;
})

local myEvent = Zyntex:GetEvent("eventName")

myEvent.Invoke:Connect(function()
  print("myEvent invoked from the dashboard!")
end)

myEvent:Invoke({
 {
   ["key"]   = "Body",
   ["value"] = "myEvent invoked from Roblox!"
 } 
})

Zyntex:Log("This is a log from Roblox.")
```

### Line 1

Line one creates a Zyntex object using your game's token. It calls the Zyntex.new() constructor automatically.

### Lines 3-5

Now, you are initialising the Zyntex object. This will connect all hooks (i.e. Zyntex's handling of player joins and live events), initialize the server on Roblox, and setup the config.

#### Config options:

`debug: boolean` = If set to true, Zyntex SDK will display verbose logging to the standard output. Useful when debugging with support.

### Line 7

Now things are getting interesting. Zyntex:GetEvent(eventName: string) gets an event by it's name, assuming it is created on the Dashboard. To learn more about events please click [here](/events).
